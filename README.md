# ew-node-file-manager
A file manager with a Node.js backend and React front-end. Everything is written in Typescript. You can either use or omit nginx depending on your preferences.
  
Run "npm i" to install dependencies in both the root and client folder.  
Run "npm run build" to build the javascript files from typescript.

Recommended aproach when developing is to run "npm run dev" from this folder.
This will activate both the node.js backend as well as the react-create-app front-end.
